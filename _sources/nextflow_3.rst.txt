Nextflow 3

Adding more processes
======================

We can build a pipeline incrementally adding more and more processes.
Nextflow will take care of the dependencies between the input / output and of the parallelization.

Let's add to the **test2.nf** pipeline two additional steps, indexing of the reference genome and the read alignment using `Bowtie <http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml>`__. For that we will have to modify the test2.nf, params.config and nexflow.config files (the new script is available in the **test3 folder**).

In **params.config**, we have to add new parameters:


.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/params.config
   :language: groovy

In **test3.nf**, we have to add a new input for the reference sequence:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/test3.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 31,32,43-48
   

This way, the **singleton channel** called **reference** is created. Its content can be used indefinitely. We also add a path specifying where to place the output files.

.. code-block:: groovy

	/*
	 * Defining the output folders.
	 */
	fastqcOutputFolder    = "${params.outdir}/output_fastqc"
	alnOutputFolder       = "${params.outdir}/output_aln"
	multiqcOutputFolder   = "${params.outdir}/output_multiQC"



And we have to add two new processes. The first one is for the indexing the reference genome (with `bowtie-build`):


.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/test3.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 82-101


Since bowtie indexing requires unzipped reference fasta file, we first **gunzip** it, then build the reference index, and finally remove the unzipped file.

The output channel is organized as a **tuple**; i.e., a list of elements.

The first element of the list is the **name of the index as a value**, the second is a **list of files constituting the index**.

The former is needed for building the command line of the alignment step, the latter are the files needed for the alignment.

The second process **bowtieAln** is the alignment step:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/test3.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 103-124


There are two different input channels, the **index** and **reads**.

The index name specified by **refname** is used for building the command line; while the index files, indicated by **ref_files**, are linked to the current directory by using the **path** qualifier.

We also produced two kind of outputs, the **alignments** and **logs**.
The first one is the one we want to keep as a final result; for that, we specify the **pattern** parameter in **publishDir**.

.. code-block:: groovy

	publishDir alnOutputFolder, pattern: '*.sam'


The second output will be passed to the next process, that is, the multiQC process. To distinguish the outputs let's assign them different names.

.. code-block:: groovy

	output:
	    path "${reads}.sam", emit: samples_sam
	    path "${reads}.log", emit: samples_log


This section will allow us to connect these outputs directly with other processes when we call them in the workflow section:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/test3.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 145-152


As you can see, we passed the **samples_log** output to the multiqc process after mixing it with the output channel from the fastqc process.


Profiles
=================

For deploying a pipeline in a cluster or Cloud, in the **nextflow.config** file, we need to indicate what kind of the `executor <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#executor>`__ to use.

In the Nextflow framework architecture, the executor indicates which the **batch-queue system** to use to submit jobs to a HPC or to Cloud.

The executor is completely abstracted, so you can switch from SGE to SLURM just by changing this parameter in the configuration file.

You can group different classes of configuration or **profiles** within a single **nextflow.config** file.

Let's inspect the **nextflow.config** file in **test3** folder. We can see three different profiles:

- standard
- cluster
- cloud

The first profile indicates the resources needed for running the pipeline locally. They are quite small since we have little power and CPU on the test node.


.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/nextflow.config
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 8-21


As you can see, we explicitly indicated the **local** executor. By definition, the local executor is a default executor if the pipeline is run without specifying a profile.

The second profile is for running the pipeline on the **cluster**; here in particular for the cluster supporting the Sun Grid Engine queuing system:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/nextflow.config
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 22-38


This profile indicates that the system uses **Sun Grid Engine** as a job scheduler and that we have different queues for small jobs and more intensive ones.

Deployment in the AWS cloud
=============================

The final profile is for running the pipeline in the **Amazon Cloud**, known as Amazon Web Services or AWS. In particular, we will use **AWS Batch** that allows the execution of containerised workloads in the Amazon cloud infrastructure (where NNNN is the number of your bucket which you can see in the mounted folder `/mnt` by typing the command **df**).

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test3/nextflow.config
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 40-57


We indicate the **AWS specific parameters** (**region** and **cliPath**) and the executor **awsbatch**.
Then we indicate the working directory, that should be mounted as `S3 volume <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`__.
This is mandatory when running Nextflow on the cloud.

We can now launch the pipeline indicating `-profile cloud`:

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run test3.nf -bg -with-docker -profile cloud > log


Note that there is no longer a **work** folder in the directory where test3.nf is located, because, in the AWS cloud, the output is copied locally in the folder **/mnt/nf-class-bucket-NNN/work** (you can see the mounted folder - and the correspondign number - typing **df**).

The multiqc report can be seen on the AWS webpage at https://nf-class-bucket-NNN.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/results/ouptut_multiQC/multiqc_report.html

But you need before to change permissions for that file as (where NNNN is the number of your bucket):

.. code-block:: console

	chmod 775 /mnt/nf-class-bucket-NNNN/results/ouptut_multiQCmultiqc_report.html


Sometimes you can find that the Nextflow process itself is very memory intensive and the main node can run out of memory. To avoid this, you can reduce the memory needed by setting an environmental variable:

.. code-block:: console

	export NXF_OPTS="-Xms50m -Xmx500m"


Again we can copy the output file to the bucket.

We can also tell Nextflow to directly copy the output file to the S3 bucket: to do so, change the parameter **outdir** in the params file (use the bucket corresponding to your AWS instance):

.. code-block:: groovy

	outdir = "s3://nf-class-bucket-NNNN/results"





EXERCISE
============

Modify the **test3.nf** file to make two sub-workflows:

* for fastqc of fastq files and bowtie alignment;
* for a fastqc analysis of the aligned files produced by bowtie.

For convenience you can use the multiqc config file called **config.yaml** in the multiqc process.

Modules and how to re-use the code
==================================

A great advantage of the new DSL2 is to allow the **modularization of the code**.
In particular, you can move a named workflow within a module and keep it aside for being accessed by different pipelines.

The **test4** folder provides an example of using modules.


.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test4/test4.nf
   :language: groovy
   

We now include two modules, named **fastqc** and **multiqc**, from ```${baseDir}/modules/fastqc.nf``` and ```${baseDir}/modules/multiqc.nf```.
Let's inspect the **multiQC** module:


.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test4/modules/multiqc.nf
   :language: groovy


The module **multiqc** takes as **input** a channel with files containing reads and produces as **output** the files generated by the multiqc program.

The module contains the directive **publishDir**, the tag, the container to be used and has similar input, output and script session as the fastqc process in **test3.nf**.

A module can contain its own parameters that can be used for connecting the main script to some variables inside the module.

In this example we have the declaration of two **parameters** that are defined at the beginning:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test4/modules/fastqc.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 5-6


They can be overridden from the main script that is calling the module:

- The parameter **params.OUTPUT** can be used for connecting the output of this module with one in the main script.
- The parameter **params.CONTAINER** can be used for declaring the image to use for this particular module.

In this example, in our main script we pass only the OUTPUT parameters by writing them as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test4/test4.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 54


While we keep the information of the container inside the module for better reproducibility:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test4/modules/multiqc.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 5


Here you see that we are not using our own image, but rather we use the image provided by **biocontainers** in `quay <https://quay.io/>`__.


Let's have a look at the **fastqc.nf** module:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test4/modules/fastqc.nf
   :language: groovy


It is very similar to the multiqc one: we just add an extra parameter for connecting the resources defined in the **nextflow.config** file and the label indicated in the process. Also in the script part there is a connection between the fastqc command line and the nnumber of threads defined in the nextflow config file.

To use this module, we have to change the main code as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test4/test4.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 55

The label **twocpus** is specified in the **nextflow.config** file for each profile:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test4/modules/nextflow.config
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 16,32,53

.. note::

	IMPORTANT: You have to specify a default image to run nextflow -with-docker or -with-singularity and you have to have a container(s) defined inside modules.

EXERCISE
===========

Make a module wrapper for the bowtie tool and change the script in test3 accordingly.

Reporting and graphical interface
===================================

Nextflow has an embedded function for reporting informations about the resources requested for each job and the timing; to generate a html report, run Nextflow with the `-with-report` parameter :

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run test5.nf -with-docker -bg -with-report > log


.. image:: images/report.png
  :width: 800


**Nextflow Tower** is an open source monitoring and managing platform for Nextflow workflows. There are two versions:

- Open source for monitoring of single pipelines.
- Commercial one for workflow management, monitoring and resource optimisation.

We will show the open source one.

First, you need to access the `tower.nf <https://tower.nf/>`__ website and login.


.. image:: images/tower.png
  :width: 800


If you selected the email for receiving the instructions and the token to be used.

.. image:: images/tower0.png
  :width: 800

check the email:

.. image:: images/tower1.png
  :width: 800



.. image:: images/tower2.png
  :width: 800


You can generate your token at `https://tower.nf/tokens <https://tower.nf/tokens>`__ and copy paste it in your pipeline using this snippet in the configuration file:

.. code-block:: groovy

	tower {
	  accessToken = '<YOUR TOKEN>'
	  enabled = true
	}


or exporting those environmental variables:

.. code-block:: groovy

	export TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN=*******YOUR***TOKEN*****HERE*******
	export NXF_VER=21.04.0


Now we can launch the pipeline:

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run test5.nf -with-singularity -with-tower -bg > log


	CAPSULE: Downloading dependency io.nextflow:nf-tower:jar:20.09.1-edge

Share Nextflow pipelines and good practices
============================================

Nextflow supports a number of code sharing platforms: **BitBucket**, **GitHub**, and **GitLab**.
This feature allows to run pipelines by just pointing to an online repository without caring about downloading etc.

The default platform is **GitHub**, so we will use this repository as an example.

Let's create a new repository with a unique name:


.. image:: images/git_1.png
  :width: 800

.. image:: images/git_2.png
  :width: 800


And then let's clone it in one of our test folder. Let's choose **test5**. We can get the url path by clicking like on the figure:

.. image:: images/git_3.png
  :width: 800

.. code-block:: console

	git clone https://github.com/lucacozzuto/test_course.git
	Cloning into 'test_course'...
	remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
	remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
	remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
	Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.


We have an almost empty folder named **test_course**. We can just move or copy our files there:

.. code-block:: console

	cp *.* lib -r test_course/
	cd test_course

	git status

	# On branch main
	# Untracked files:
	#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	#
	#	lib/
	#	nextflow.config
	#	params.config
	#	test5.nf
	nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)


Now we are ready for committing and pushing everything to the online repository. But before we need to rename **test5.nf** to **main.nf**.

.. code-block:: groovy

	mv test5.nf main.nf

	git add *

	git status
	# On branch main
	# Changes to be committed:
	#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
	#
	#	new file:   lib/bowtie.nf
	#	new file:   lib/fastqc.nf
	#	new file:   lib/multiqc.nf
	#	new file:   nextflow.config
	#	new file:   params.config
	#	new file:   main.nf
	#


	git commit -m "first commit"

	   bbd6a44..7681f85  main -> main


If we go back to the GitHub website we can see that everything has been uploaded.

.. image:: images/git_2.png
  :width: 800

Now we can remove that folder and go in the home folder.

.. code-block:: console

	rm -fr test_course
	cd $HOME


And we can launch directly this pipeline with:

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run lucacozzuto/test_course -with-docker -r main \
	--reads "/home/ec2-user/git/CoursesCRG_Containers_Nextflow_May_2022/testdata/*.fastq.gz" \
	--reference "/home/ec2-user/git/CoursesCRG_Containers_Nextflow_May_2022/testdata/chr19.fasta.gz"


As you can see we just use the repository name and two Nextflow parameters:

- `-with-docker`, for using Docker
- `-r`, for using a specific branch. In this case the **main** branch.

Then we pass to the pipelines the path of our input files:
- `--reads`
- `--reference`

.. code-block:: console

Nextflow first pulls down the required version of the pipeline and stores it in:

.. code-block:: console

	/home/ec2-user/.nextflow/assets/lucacozzuto/test_course/


then it pulls the Docker image and runs the pipeline.

You can use the Nextflow command **list** to see pipelines installed in your environment and the command **info** to fetch information about the path, repository, etc.

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow list
	lucacozzuto/test_course
	...


.. code-block:: console

	nextflow info lucacozzuto/test_course

	 project name: lucacozzuto/test_course
	 repository  : https://github.com/lucacozzuto/test_course
	 local path  : /home/ec2-user/.nextflow/assets/lucacozzuto/test_course
	 main script : main.nf
	 revision    : * main


Finally, you can update, view or delete a project by using the Nextflow commands **pull**, **view** and **drop**.

.. code-block:: groovy

	nextflow view lucacozzuto/test_course
