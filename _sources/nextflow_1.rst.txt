What is Nextflow?
-----------------

.. image:: images/nextf_groovy.png
  :width: 600

`Nextflow <https://www.nextflow.io>`__ is a domain specific language (DSL) for workflow orchestration that stems from `Groovy <https://groovy-lang.org/>`__. It enables scalable and reproducible workflows using software containers.
It was developed at the `CRG <www.crg.eu>`__ in the Lab of Cedric Notredame by `Paolo Di Tommaso <https://github.com/pditommaso>`__.
The Nextflow documentation is `available here <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/>`__ and you can ask help to the community using their `gitter channel <https://gitter.im/nextflow-io/nextflow>`__ or joining their `slack channel <https://join.slack.com/t/nextflow/shared_invite/zt-11iwlxtw5-R6SNBpVksOJAx5sPOXNrZg>`__. 

In 2020, Nextflow has been upgraded from DSL1 version to DSL2. In this course we will use exclusively DSL2. It is currently developed and mantained by the company `Seqera Labs <https://seqera.io/>`__

What is Nextflow for?
---------------------

It is for making pipelines without caring about parallelization, dependencies, intermediate file names, data structures, handling exceptions, resuming executions, etc.

It was published in `Nature Biotechnology in 2017 <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28398311/>`__.

There is a growing number of `PubMed <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=nextflow&timeline=expanded&sort=pubdate&sort_order=asc>`__ publications citing Nextflow.

A curated list of `Nextflow pipelines <https://github.com/nextflow-io/awesome-nextflow>`__.

Many pipelines written collaboratively are provided by the `NF-core <https://nf-co.re/pipelines>`__ project.

Some pipelines written in Nextflow have been used for the SARS-Cov-2 analysis too, for example:

- The `artic Network <https://artic.network/ncov-2019>`__ pipeline `ncov2019-artic-nf <https://github.com/connor-lab/ncov2019-artic-nf>`__.
- The `CRG / EGA viral Beacon <https://covid19beacon.crg.eu/info>`__ pipeline `Master of Pores <https://github.com/biocorecrg/master_of_pores>`__.
- The nf-core pipeline `viralrecon <https://nf-co.re/viralrecon>`__.


Main advantages
----------------


- **Fast prototyping**

You can quickly write a small pipeline that can be **expanded incrementally**.
**Each task is independent** and can be easily added to other. You can reuse scripts without re-writing or adapting them.

- **Reproducibility**

Nextflow supports **Docker** and **Singularity** containers technology. Their use will make the pipelines reproducible in any Unix environment. Nextflow is integrated with **GitHub code sharing platform**, so you can call directly a specific version of a pipeline from a repository, download and use it on-the-fly.

- **Portability**

Nextflow can be executed on **multiple platforms** without modifiying the code. It supports several schedulers such as **SGE, LSF, SLURM, PBS, HTCondor** and cloud platforms like **Kubernetes, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud**.


.. image:: images/executors.png
  :width: 600

- **Scalability**

Nextflow is based on the **dataflow programming model** which simplifies writing complex pipelines.
The tool takes care of **parallelizing the processes** without additionally written code.
The resulting applications are inherently parallel and can scale-up or scale-out transparently; there is no need to adapt them to a specific platform architecture.

- **Resumable, thanks to continuous checkpoints**

All the intermediate results produced during the pipeline execution are automatically tracked.
For each process **a temporary folder is created and is cached (or not) once resuming an execution**.

Workflow structure
-------------------

The workflows can be represented as graphs where the nodes are the **processes** and the edges are the **channels**.
The **processes** are blocks of code that can be executed - such as scripts or programs - while the **channels** are asynchronous queues able to **connect processes among them via input / output**.


.. image:: images/wf_example.png
  :width: 600


Processes are independent from each another and can be run in parallel, depending on the number of elements in a channel.
In the previous example, processes **A**, **B** and **C** can be run in parallel and only when they **ALL** end the process **D** is triggered.

Installation
------------

.. note::
  Nextflow is already installed on the machines provided for this course.
  You need at least the Java version 8 for the Nextflow installation.

.. tip::
  You can check the version fo java by typing::

    java -version

Then we can install Nextflow with::

  curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash

This will create the ``nextflow`` executable that can be moved, for example, to ``/usr/local/bin``.

We can test that the installation was successful with:

.. code-block:: console

  nextflow run hello

  N E X T F L O W  ~  version 20.07.1
  Pulling nextflow-io/hello ...
  downloaded from https://github.com/nextflow-io/hello.git
  Launching `nextflow-io/hello` [peaceful_brahmagupta] - revision: 96eb04d6a4 [master]
  executor >  local (4)
  [d7/d053b5] process > sayHello (4) [100%] 4 of 4 ✔
  Ciao world!
  Bonjour world!
  Hello world!
  Hola world!


This command downloads and runs the pipeline ``hello``.

We can now launch a test pipeline:

.. code-block:: console

  nextflow run nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf -with-singularity

This command will automatically pull the pipeline and the required test data from the `github repository <https://github.com/nextflow-io/rnatoy>`__
The command ``-with-singularity`` will automatically trigger the download of the image ``nextflow/rnatoy:1.3`` from DockerHub and convert it on-the-fly into a singularity image that will be used for running each step of the pipeline.
The pipeline can also recognize the queue system which is used on the machine where it is launched. In the following examples, I launched the same pipeline both on the CRG high performance computing (HPC) cluster and on my MacBook:

Nextflow main concepts.
========================

Channels and Operators
-------------------------

There are two different types of channels:

- A **queue channel** is a non-blocking unidirectional `FIFO <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)>`__ (First In, First Out) queue which **connects two processes or operators**.
- A **value channel**, a.k.a. singleton channel, is bound to a single value and can be read unlimited times without consuming its content.

An **operator** is a method that reshapes or connects different channels applying specific rules.

We can write a very simple Nextflow script: save the following piece of code in a file called ``ex1.nf``. All the examples are in the folder
**/nextflow/examples/** while the scripts are in folders named **/nextflow/test**

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/examples/ex1.nf
   :language: groovy

Once the file is saved, execute it with:

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run ex1.nf

	N E X T F L O W  ~  version 20.07.1
	Launching `ex1.nf` [agitated_avogadro] - revision: 61a595c5bf
	hello
	hola
	bonjour


As you can see, the **Channel** is just a collection of values, but it can also be a collection of **file paths**.

Let's create three empty files with the `touch` command:

.. code-block:: console

	touch aa.txt bb.txt cc.txt


and make another script (ex2.nf) with the following code:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/examples/ex2.nf
   :language: groovy



We can now execute `ex2.nf`:

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run ex2.nf

	N E X T F L O W  ~  version 20.07.1
	Launching `ex2.nf` [condescending_hugle] - revision: f513c0fac3
	/home/ec2-user/git/CoursesCRG_Containers_Nextflow_May_2021/nextflow/aa.txt
	/home/ec2-user/git/CoursesCRG_Containers_Nextflow_May_2021/nextflow/bb.txt
	/home/ec2-user/git/CoursesCRG_Containers_Nextflow_May_2021/nextflow/cc.txt


Once executed, we can see that a folder named **work** is generated. Nextflow stores in this folder the intermediate files generated by the processes.

In genomics we often have couple of files that have to be processed at the same times, such as the paired end reads etc. For this Nextflow allow using a special method for generating "tuples" from file pairs. 

We can simulate this situation by generating a couple of files:

.. code-block:: console

	touch aaa_1.txt aaa_2.txt

Then we use `fromFilePairs <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/channel.html#fromfilepairs>`__ for generating a tuple (script **ex3.nf**):


.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/examples/ex3.nf
   :language: groovy

Executing it will show the emission of a tuple which key is the common part of the two input files:

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run ex3.nf 
	N E X T F L O W  ~  version 21.10.6
	Launching `ex3.nf` [reverent_ampere] - revision: 87d78a151f
	[aaa, [/nfs/users/bi/lcozzuto/aaa/CoursesCRG_Containers_Nextflow_May_2022/nextflow/examples/aaa_1.txt, /nfs/users/bi/lcozzuto/aaa/CoursesCRG_Containers_Nextflow_May_2022/nextflow/examples/aaa_2.txt]]


We can reshape the channels in several ways and / or cross them using operators so that they can be used for a particular purpose. In brief, each "emission" of a channel can be used by a process for a specific purpose.  


Exercise
-------------------------
Using again the previous 3 `.txt` files ("aa.txt", "bb.txt", "cc.txt"), reshape the channels to emit:

  - A single channel with a **single emission** with all the files
  - A channel with each possible file combination ( A vs A, A vs B, A vs C etc..)
  - A tuple with a custom id, i.e. something like ["custom id", ["aa.txt", "bb.txt", "cc.txt"]]


See here the list of `Operators <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/operator.html#>`__ available at the official documentation.

Processes
-------------

Let's add a process to the previous script `ex1.nf` and let's call it `ex1_a.nf`

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/examples/ex1_a.nf
   :language: groovy



The process can be seen as a function that is composed of:

- An **input** part where the input channels are defined.
- An **output** part where we specify what to store as a result, that will be sent to other processes or published as final result.
- A **script** part where we have the block of code to be executed using data from the input channel, and that will produce the output for the ouput channel.

Any kind of code / command line can be run there, as it is **language agnostic**.


.. note::
	You can have some trouble with escaping some characters: in that case, it is better to save the code into a file and call that file as a program.

.. tip::
	Before the input, you can indicate a **tag** that will be reported in the log. This is quite useful for **logging / debugging**.


Workflow
------------

The code above will produce nothing (actually a warning), because it requires the part that will actually **call the process** and connect it to the input channel.

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run ex1_a.nf -dsl2
	N E X T F L O W  ~  version 22.04.3

	=============================================================================

This part is called a **workflow**.

Let's add a workflow to our code `ex1_a.nf`. Now we will have our first prototype of a Nextflow pipeline, so we can rename it `test0.nf`. You can find this code in **/nextflow/test0/** folder:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test0/test0.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 63-66


We can run the script sending the execution in the background (with the `-bg` option) and saving the log in the file `log.txt`.

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run test0.nf -bg > log.txt


Nextflow log
================

Let's inspect the log file:

.. code-block:: console

	cat log.txt

	N E X T F L O W  ~  version 20.07.1
	Launching `test0.nf` [high_fermat] - revision: b129d66e57
	[6a/2dfcaf] Submitted process > printHello (hola)
	[24/a286da] Submitted process > printHello (hello)
	[04/e733db] Submitted process > printHello (bonjour)
	hola in Italian is ciao
	hello in Italian is ciao
	bonjour in Italian is ciao


The **tag** allows us to see that the process **printHello** was launched three times using the *hola*, *hello* and *bonjour* values contained in the input channel.


At the start of each row, there is an **alphanumeric code**:

.. code-block:: console

	**[6a/2dfcaf]** Submitted process > printHello (hola)

This code indicates **the path** in which the process is "isolated" and where the corresponding temporary files are kept in the **work** directory.

.. note::
	**IMPORTANT: Nextflow will randomly generate temporary folders so they will be named differently in your execution!!!**

Let's have a look inside that folder:

.. code-block:: console

	# Show the folder's full name

	echo work/6a/2dfcaf*
	  work/6a/2dfcafc01350f475c60b2696047a87

	# List was is inside the folder

	ls -alht work/6a/2dfcaf*
	total 40
	-rw-r--r--  1 lcozzuto  staff     1B Oct  7 13:39 .exitcode
	drwxr-xr-x  9 lcozzuto  staff   288B Oct  7 13:39 .
	-rw-r--r--  1 lcozzuto  staff    24B Oct  7 13:39 .command.log
	-rw-r--r--  1 lcozzuto  staff    24B Oct  7 13:39 .command.out
	-rw-r--r--  1 lcozzuto  staff     0B Oct  7 13:39 .command.err
	-rw-r--r--  1 lcozzuto  staff     0B Oct  7 13:39 .command.begin
	-rw-r--r--  1 lcozzuto  staff    45B Oct  7 13:39 .command.sh
	-rw-r--r--  1 lcozzuto  staff   2.5K Oct  7 13:39 .command.run
	drwxr-xr-x  3 lcozzuto  staff    96B Oct  7 13:39 ..


You see a lot of "hidden" files:

- **.exitcode**, contains 0 if everything is ok, another value if there was a problem.
- **.command.log**, contains the log of the command execution. It is often identical to `.command.out`
- **.command.out**, contains the standard output of the command execution
- **.command.err**, contains the standard error of the command execution
- **.command.begin**, contains what has to be executed before `.command.sh`
- **.command.sh**, contains the block of code indicated in the process
- **.command.run**, contains the code made by nextflow for the execution of `.command.sh`, and contains environmental variables, eventual invocations of linux containers etc.

For example, the content of `.command.sh` is:

.. code-block:: console

	cat work/6a/2dfcaf*/.command.sh

	#!/bin/bash -ue
	echo hola in Italian is ciao


And the content of `.command.out` is

.. code-block:: console

	cat work/6a/2dfcaf*/.command.out

	hola in Italian is ciao


You can also name the sub workflows to combine them in the main workflow. 
For example, using this code you can execute two different workflows that contain the same process. As you can see the named workflows work similarly to the process: the input is defined by the **take** keyword, while the **script** part is represented by the **main**. We also have an equivalent of **output** that is **emit** that will be described later on. The following script can be found in `test0_b.nf` file


.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test0/test0_b.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 27-32,39-44



We can add the **collect** operator to the second workflow that would collect the output from different executions and return the resulting list **as a sole emission**.

Let's run the code:

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run test0_b.nf -bg > log2
	
	cat log2

	N E X T F L O W  ~  version 20.07.1
	Launching `test0_b.nf` [irreverent_davinci] - revision: 25a5511d1d

	[8d/270d93] Submitted process > first_pipeline:printHello (hola)

	[0f/f78baf] Submitted process > second_pipeline:printHello (bonjour)
	hola in Italian is ciao
	['hello in Italian is ciao\n', 'hola in Italian is ciao\n', 'bonjour in Italian is ciao\n']



We can change the pipeline to produce files instead of `standard output <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html#process-outputs>`__. The script is named **test0_c.nf**.


.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test0/test0_c.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 13,14,18,27,28,32


More complex scripts
============

We can feed the channel that is generated by a process to another process in the workflow definition. The variable used by AWK need to be escaped, otherwise they will be considered as proper Nextflow variables and thus produce an error. Every special character, e.g., **$**, needs to be escaped (**\$**). It can be tedeous when writing long one liners; therefore, it is recommended to make a small shell script and call it as an executable. It has to be placed in a folder named **bin** inside the pipeline folder to be automatically considered from Nextflow as a tool in the path. This script can be seen at **/test1/test1.nf**


.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test1/test1.nf
   :language: groovy

Here we have two simple processes:

- the former splits the input fasta file into **single sequences**.
- the latter is able to **reverse the position of the sequences**.

The input path is fed as a parameter using the script parameters **${seq}**

.. code-block:: groovy

	params.inputfile


.. note::
	The file "test.fa" is available in the `github repository of the course <https://github.com/biocorecrg/CoursesCRG_Containers_Nextflow_May_2021/tree/main/testdata>`__


This value can be overridden when calling the script:

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run test1.nf --inputfile another_input.fa


The workflow part connects the two processes so that the output of the first process becomes an input of the second process.

During the execution, Nextflow creates a number of temporary folders and also a soft link to the original input file. It will then store output files locally.

The output file is then *linked* in other folders for being used as input from other processes.
This avoids clashes, and each process is isolated from the other.

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run test1.nf -bg

File `test.fa` is a *soft link* to the original input.


If we inspect `work/fe/0a8640*` that is generated by the process **reverseSequence**, we see that the files generated by **splitSequences** are now linked as input.

.. code-block:: console

	ls -l work/fe/0a8640*

At this point we can make two different workflows to demonstrate how the new DSL allows reusing the code (script name **test1_b.nf**).

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test1/test1_b.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 49-63

The first workflow will just run like the previous script, while the second will "flatten" the output of the first process and will launch the second process on each single sequence.

The **reverseSequence** process of the second workflow will run in parallel if you have enough processors, or if you are running the script in a cluster environment, with a scheduler supported by Nextflow.

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run test1_b.nf -bg

	C02WX1XFHV2Q:nextflow lcozzuto$ N E X T F L O W  ~  version 20.07.1

Directives
------------


The `directives <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#directives>`__ are declaration blocks that can provide optional settings for a process.


For example, they can affect the way a process stages in and out the input and output files (`stageInMode <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#stageinmode>`__ and `stageOutMode <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#stageoutmode>`__), or they can indicate which file has to be considered a final result and in which folder it should be published (`publishDir <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#publishdir>`__).

We can add the directive `publishDir <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#publishdir>`__ to our previous example:

.. literalinclude:: ../nextflow/test1/test1_c.nf
   :language: groovy
   :emphasize-lines: 37


The script name with this modification is **test1_c.nf**.

We can also use `storeDir <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#storedir>`__ in case we want to have a permanent cache.

The process is executed only if the output files do not exist in the folder specified by **storeDir**.

When the output files exist, the process execution is skipped and these files are used as the actual process result.

We can also indicate what to do if a process fails.

The default is to stop the pipeline and to raise an error. But we can also skip the process using the `errorStrategy <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#errorstrategy>`__ directive:

.. code-block:: groovy

	errorStrategy 'ignore'


or retry a number of times changing the available memory or the maximum execution time, using the foolowing directives:


.. code-block:: groovy

	memory { 1.GB * task.attempt }
	time { 1.hour * task.attempt }
	errorStrategy 'retry'
	maxRetries 3


Resuming a pipeline
---------------------

You can resume the execution after the code modification using the parameter **-resume**.

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run test1.nf -bg -resume

	N E X T F L O W  ~  version 20.07.1
	Launching `test1.nf` [determined_celsius] - revision: eaf5b4d673

	[45/86dd83] Cached process > flow2:reverseSequence (seq_1)

.. note::

	**IMPORTANT: Nextflow parameters are provided using one hyphen** (`-resume`) **while a pipeline parameters, two hyphens** (`\-\-inputfile`).

Sometimes you might want to resume a previous run of your pipeline.

To do so you need to extract the job id of that run. You can do this by using the command `nextflow log`.

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow log
	TIMESTAMP          	DURATION	RUN NAME           	STATUS	REVISION ID	SESSION ID                          	COMMAND
	2020-10-06 14:49:09	2s      	agitated_avogadro  	OK    	61a595c5bf 	4a7a8a4b-9bdb-4b15-9cc6-1b2cabe9a938	nextflow run test1.nf

	2020-10-08 19:30:59	2.3s    	disturbed_wozniak  	OK    	d33befe154 	0a19b60d-d5fe-4a26-9e01-7a63d0a1d300	nextflow run test1.nf -bg
	2020-10-08 19:35:52	2.5s    	insane_plateau     	OK    	d33befe154 	b359f32c-254f-4271-95bb-6a91b281dc6d	nextflow run test1.nf -bg
	2020-10-08 19:56:30	2.8s    	determined_celsius 	OK    	eaf5b4d673 	b359f32c-254f-4271-95bb-6a91b281dc6d	nextflow run test1.nf -bg -resume


You can then resume the state of your execution using the **SESSION ID**:

.. code-block:: console

	nextflow run -resume 0a19b60d-d5fe-4a26-9e01-7a63d0a1d300 test1.nf


Nextflow's cache can be disabled for a specific process by setting the directive **cache** to **false**. You can also choose among the three caching methods:

.. code-block:: groovy

	cache = true // (default) Cache keys are created indexing input files meta-data information (name, size and last update timestamp attributes).

	cache = 'deep' // Cache keys are created indexing input files content.

	cache = 'lenient' // (Best in HPC and shared file systems) Cache keys are created indexing input files path and size attributes


**IMPORTANT: On some shared file systems you might have inconsistent file timestamps. Thus cache lenient prevents you from unwanted restarting of cached processes.**

EXERCISE
---------

Make the previous pipeline resilient to the process failing and save the results so the process execution would be skipped when the pipeline is launched again.

First, make the process `reverseSequence` to fail by introducing a typo in the command line, then add the directive to the process.

Write the first workflow using pipes. Nextflow DLS2 allows you to use pipes for connecting channels via input / output.

See the `documentation on pipes <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html#pipes>`__.
